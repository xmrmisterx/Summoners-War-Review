-ok, so, we need to create our backend site for the mountain website, but the wikipedia apis might be down? I'm not sure, but we'll work
on this until it's up, then we need to get it up, and create the setInterval function on it as well
-for this SW site, let's put everything (except Notes) into a public folder (including script.js), then create the package.json, Procfile
and server.js file and put this one up. It should be fast since this is only front end.
-ok, so the heroku local works, and we read through all the pages, and made some edits, so it reads a lot better now. So this page is
essentially done, but there is one thing, we are using the scroll boxes, but they don't make sense in the context of a one column page,
so can we change the equipment page to have multiple columns for the content?
-so, we were able to google and get the 4 column code, but the columns seemed stuck to each other and pretty bad, so then we noticed that it had padding on one of the examples, so we do "padding: 10 px", but that wasn't even noticeable. However, "padding: 50 px" was and made the columns look a lot better. Let's review the pages, then upload this.
-alright, we've proofread the content a second time, and made more changes, I think we can upload now
- after 'heroku create', our APP ADDRESS: https://warm-garden-39926.herokuapp.com/ and APP GIT ADDRESS: 
https://git.heroku.com/warm-garden-39926.git, ok, it's up and running and everything is running great
