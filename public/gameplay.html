  <h1>Gameplay</h1>
  <p1>Summoner's war is not a game of instant gratification. For a beginner, it might take weeks to get a team strong enough to
    start farming dungeons for runes. Initially, monsters are at a low level, and must gain xp points from fights to level up, as is 
    standard in most role playing games. However, leveling up may take longer than what the player is used to. For example, it can take a
    day just to level up a monster to the max 6 star level, so the gameplay is definitely grindy. 
  </p1>
  <br></br>
  <p2>A typical day starts with the daily missions, which are simple tasks, but can take about 30 minutess depending on how far along
    the player is. Players are incentivized to join a guild with other players in order to farm for more resources. When in a guild,
    there are guild wars every 12 hours and siege battles twice a week. Depending on the strength of the player's guild and the strength
    of the opposing guild, battles can range from 30 secs to 30 mins. There are also monthly trial of ascension levels that can be cleared
    for a very generous amount of resources, plus a monthly dimensional predator that will give a choice between several strong runes.
  </p2>
  <br></br>
  <p3>Once a player is strong enough, they can fight in the world arena, where they are matched up against other players
    from around the world. This is a real time strategy match, so each move needs to be quick and precise in order to achieve 
    victory. In the beginning of a world arena match, the players alternate monster choices until the
    teams are full. At the end of the draft, each player can ban one enemy monster, ideally the enemy monster that most 
    counters their team.

  <p4>Below is a list of some of the pros and cons of the game.</p4>
  <br></br>
  <div><b>Pros</b></div>
  <ul>
      <li>With daily missions, guild war, siege and real world arena, there is a plethora of content to keep the player busy.
      </li>
      <li>The really low rates for summons and runes means the grind is never over. Despite the game being around for 6 years, 
        nobody has a set of perfect runes yet, so there is always motivation to keep farming.
      </li>
      <li>Summoning monsters and equipping monsters with runes is really fun.</li>
  </ul>
  <div><b>Cons</b></div>
  <ul>
      <li>The game mostly plays on auto, where the player creates teams to farm dungeons, then just runs them over and over again to get the 
        desired runes. This is good for players who don't have much time, or those who don't want to pay too much attention to the game, but 
        bad for players who want more interaction. With that said, world arena is fun and very strategic, but it's the only mode
        that actually lets players fight each other in real time.
      </li>
      <li>The low rates for good monsters and runes can make the game frustrating at times. It is not uncommon to go months without
        getting a nat 5 monster or a usable rune.
      </li>
      <li>Violent runes, which can grant an extra turn, are too strong in the game and
          often lead to frustrating battles decided by luck and not skill.
      </li>
      <li>There are packages that can be bought for real money that let players reroll their runes for better stats, which leads to
        the game being dominated at the higher levels by "whales," or people who spend a lot of money on the game.
      </li>
